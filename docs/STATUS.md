# Gwave — live system status

> Every Claude session: read this before working, update it after shipping.
> Keep entries short; newest changelog entries on top.

## Current state (2026-07-23)

- **Web**: main auto-deploys to gwave.cc (ECR image + `gwave-redeploy` on EC2).
  vercel.app hosts 308-redirect to gwave.cc; the old Vercel project should be
  deleted by the owner.
- **APK**: signed builds publish to the `mobile-latest` release on every push
  to `mobile/**` (main or claude/**). Settings footer shows the build number
  and call-socket status ("Gwave v1.0.N · calls: ready"). In-app update
  banner works from v1.0.99 onward. `profiles.app_build` heartbeat column
  reports each user's installed build.
- **Calls**: TURN relay (coturn on the EC2 host, 18.139.214.180:3478) is live;
  `/api/webrtc/ice` serves it; SG ports open. App: ringtone/ringback +
  vibration, speaker toggle, 20-min Realtime auth refresh, ring-socket
  auto-reconnect + resume rejoin, web-push callee notify
  (`/api/mobile/call/notify`). Web ring verification is embed-free.
- **Live**: browser→LiveKit, app-broadcast→IVS. IVS auto-records to S3;
  `latestIvsRecordingPath()` links `recording_path` on end/verify, and
  `/recordings/[...path]` streams replays through the domain (app + web).
  Media-plane self-heal on `/api/mobile/live/verify`, `/api/mobile/live/token`
  and the web watch page marks dead lives ended (LiveKit host-absent or IVS
  channel offline, 3-min grace). Feed + live lists autoplay muted previews
  (app: video_player HLS; web: hls.js / Safari native). App live viewing is
  one-page TikTok-style vertical swipe. **LiveKit (browser Go Live) recording
  still NOT configured** — needs static IAM keys for egress
  (`LIVEKIT_EGRESS_S3_*` in `/etc/gwave-web.env`).
- **SOS**: reason/phone/note/photo/video/voice + optional go-live; danger
  banner on the map; tiles dial/view media; SMS+GPS fallback when offline.
  (`sos_alerts` columns applied on RDS.)
- **Offline chat**: nearby_connections P2P (Bluetooth/WiFi, no internet) with
  GPS location sharing; friendly Burmese error guidance when Play Services
  Nearby is unavailable.
- **iPhone**: PWA install guide on /welcome. Native iOS blocked on Apple
  Developer Program enrollment.
- **Presence**: `profiles.last_seen_at` migrated on RDS; green dots live.
- **Repo hygiene**: 100 merged branches + old TWA releases deleted
  (`.github/workflows/cleanup-branches.yml` is a reusable manual cleanup).

## Known gaps / next candidates

- FCM push notifications (calls/messages don't ring when the app is closed;
  web-push covers open-browser cases only). Needs a Firebase project.
- LiveKit egress recording envs + IAM access key (see above) so browser
  Go Live sessions get replays like app broadcasts do.
- Native iOS app (Apple Developer Program, $99/yr, user-side).
- Old Vercel project deletion (user-side).

## Changelog

- 2026-07-24 (later): Media quality upgrade — new `src/lib/hls-quality.ts`
  with two shared hls.js profiles that auto-recover from fatal network/media
  errors (feed/rail/grid previews `attachPreviewHls`, watch/CCTV players
  uncapped high-quality `attachFullHls`), so live previews no longer freeze on
  a hiccup; feed/lightbox photos get async decode + priority hints + full-res
  lightbox (PR #351, merged). App: feed/story/chat photos bumped to
  `FilterQuality.medium` for crisper Retina downscaling (mobile branch).
- 2026-07-23 (later): IVS replays end-to-end (`latestIvsRecordingPath` +
  `/recordings` proxy, PR #339/#340); media-plane live self-heal + web watch
  page reverse check (PR #337/#342); web feed live cards autoplay via hls.js
  incl. replays (PR #343); app: TikTok-style live swipe, feed/live-list muted
  autoplay, double-tap react, SOS details+media+SMS fallback, offline nearby
  chat + friendly errors, profile header redesign, call notify + reconnect

  columns applied on RDS.
